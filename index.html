                        <p>Java is a powerful object-oriented programming language introduced by Sun Microsystems in 1995, which
                            has built-in support to create programs with a graphical user interface (GUI), utilize the Internet,
                            create client-server solutions, and much more. Programs written in Java can run, without change,
                            on any of the common computer operating systems Windows 95/NT, Macintosh, and Unix. A variant
                            of Java programs called applets can be embedded inside a web page and execute on the computer
                            that is viewing the page, automatically and in a secure environment.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            As a language, Java is closely related to C++, which is also object-oriented but retains a lot of idiosyncrasies inherited
                            from its predecessor language C. Java has removed the inconsistent elements from C++, is exclusively
                            object-oriented, and can be considered a modern version of C++.1 Because of its logical structure
                            Java has quickly become a popular choice as a teaching language,2 and because of its extensive
                            Internet support and the promise of writing programs once and using them on every operating system
                            Java is becoming more and more accepted in industry.

                    <article>
                        <p>Every Java program must follow these guidelines:</p> &nbsp;
                        <li>Java is case sensitive, i.e. the word Program is different from program.</li>
                        <li>Curly brackets { and } are used to group statements together.</li>
                        <li>An executable Java program must contain at least the following lines as a framework:</li>
                        <code>
                             public class Name 
                             { public static void main(String args[]) 
                                { ... program code ... } 
                            }
                        </code>
                        <li>Every statement whose next statement is not a separate group must end in a semicolon.</li>
                        <li>A Java program containing the above framework must be saved using the filename Name.java, where Name
                            (including correct upper and lower cases) is the word that follows the keywords public class
                            and the file extension is .java.</li>

                        <p>
                            In other words, to create a Java program you first create a text file containing the lines
                            <br>
                            <code>
                                 public class Name { 
                                     public static void main(String args[])
                                     { ... more lines ... } 
                                    }
                             </code> The file containing our code is called the source code file.

                        <p>
                            A Java source code file is a text file that contains programming code written according to the Java language specifications,
                            resembling a mixture of mathematical language and English. A computer cannot execute source code,
                            but humans can read and understand it.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Java source code files should be saved as Name.java, where Name is the name that appears in the first line of the program:
                            public class Name. That Name is referred to as the name of the class, or program. By convention
                            its first letter is capitalized.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Here is an example of a Java source code file. We will later explain what the various lines mean; for now it is simply a
                            text file that looks as shown.
                        </p>

                        <h5>Example: The first source code file</h5>
                        <p>Create a source code file containing the necessary Java code to get the computer to write "Hi – this
                            is my first program" on the screen.</p>
                        Our first Java program looks as follows:
                        <br>
                        <code>
                             public class Test 
                             { public static void main(String args[]) 
                                { 
                                    System.out.println("Hi – this is my first program"); 
                                } 
                            }
                         </code> This program, or class, is called Test and must be saved under the file name Test.java.

                        <p>
                            A source code file, which is more or less readable in plain English, needs to be transformed into another format before the
                            computer can act upon it. That translation process is called compiling and is accomplished using
                            the Java compiler javac from the Java Developer's Kit (JDK), which could be invoked by an IDE
                            such as BlueJ.
                        </p>
                        <h4>Compiling:</h4>
                        <p>
                            Compiling is the process of transforming the source code file into a format that the computer can understand and process.
                            The resulting file is called the byte-code, or class, file. The name of the class file is the
                            same as the name of the program plus the extension .class. The program javac from the Java Developer's
                            Kit is used to transform a source code file into a class file.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            If a source code contains any errors, they are flagged by the compiler. You need to fix them and re-compile until there are
                            no further errors.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The Java compiler does not produce an executable file, so Java programs can not execute under the operating system of your
                            machine. Instead they execute inside a Java Virtual Machine, which is invoked using the java
                            program of the JDK.
                        </p>
                        <h4>Executing a Class File</h4>
                        <p>To execute a Java program the Java Developer's Kit provides a program called java. When executing
                            that program with your class file as parameter the following happens:
                        </p>
                        <li>the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) is created inside your computer</li>
                        <li>the JVM locates and reads your class files</li>
                        <li>the JVM inspects your class file for any security violations</li>
                        <li>
                            the JVM executes, or interprets, your class file according to its instructions if possible Under Windows and Unix, execute
                            a program by typing at the command prompt java Name, where Name is the name of the program (no
                            extension). On a Macintosh, double-click the java icon and select the appropriate class file.
                        </li>

                        <p>
                            Most IDE’s allow for a convenient way to execute a file. In BlueJ you right-click on a compiled class and select the “main”
                            method.
                        </p>
